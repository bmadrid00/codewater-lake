May 16, 2023
Today I worked on CREATING the reservation routers/queries. We all took turns creating a router and a query.

May 17, 2023
Today, we worked on jwt-down authentication and troubleshooting queries/routers.

May 18, 2023
Today, I started to plan out how to implement a signup feature for all users looking to make a profile. We also went over some bugs I had for the reserversation queries/routers. 

May 19, 2023
Today, I worked on the signup page. Had issues setting up docker build due to mac issues.

May 22, 2023
Today, I still worked on creating the signup page. I was having a hard time trying to understand the difference between using the rkt qeruery and using a redux slice so I took majority of the day just trying brush up on these concepts. 

May 23, 2023
Today, I had decided to setup the signup page as an individual redux slice which took most of my time finally getting it to work but later on the day the team had recommended to keep everything consistent as what we learned in lecture(not having these implementations as its own slice). I had to refactor the entire signup page but it was a great expereince and helped remind me that instead of making my own decsions I'm not be confident in, I should communicate with the team behorehand to make sure the process goes smoothly.  Stayed up all night and finally got it to work!

May 24, 2023
Today, the team helped me fix some of the bugs I had on my signup page. We used the rest of the day pushing my final signup changes into main. 

May 25, 2023
Today, I was looking to take on more tasks as I wanted to make sure I was available for the team. 

May 26, 2023
Today, I worked on creating 3 out of 6 cabins for our project. Took most of the day looking for images.

May 30, 2023
Today, I was still working on creating cabins and the properties needed to make the cabins. Later on the night I finished up making the descriptions for each cabin as well as its other properties.

May 31, 2023
Today, there were some bug issues with the cabins I created. I spent most of the day getting that fixed. Once finished I was looking for more work to do for the team and realized we still haven't implemented an 3rd party API. I communicated with my group how they wanted this api set up. Got great feedback and started my new task.

May 1, 2023
BRUTAL DAY. I spent all night before rewatching lectures on how to implement the 3rd party API as well as other resources. Was not able to get anything going and had to ask the team how to go about this task. Worked on it for a bit and still couldnt get much going. Went to the instructors and expressed my frustration. They had recommonded to keep it simple and instead of creating a weather slice, I should just incorporate this 3rd party api to the front end as a fetch. Communicated with the team in regarding this recommondation since in the beginning they expressed to me that the group wanted to keep everything redux. They had no issues with my using a fetch call for this task. I spent the entire evening figuring how I wanted to implement this feature.

May 2, 2023
Today, I spent all day working on this feature. I had many issues just trying to get this data appear.

May 4, 2023
I spent the entire weekend trying to create this feature on a bootstrap card. I kept running into errors and fixing them.

May 5, 2023
Practice exam day. Spent the entire afternoon/evening working on the Weather feature. I kept breaking my code trying to get the icons to appear as well as mapping out the daily forecast. Frustrating stuff but great learning experience. 

May 6, 2023
Today I was still fixing the weather feature. 

May 7, 2023
Today, I finishd up the weather feature and getting some of the css stuff cleaned up how the team wanted. I started the 404 page but decided to put that on pause since I still haven't done my part on testing database endpoints. 

MAY 8, 2023 
Today I worked on finisihing up creating a cabin test. Had issues with my test and issues with the test appearing on my docker. 

May 9, 2023
Today, the team was ready to submit our projects. Team helped me fix my test and get it to work! Making final last minute touch ups before submiting.
